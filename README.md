# Thermometer Program in Python
# Created using a Raspberry Pi, thermistor, capacitor, resistor and LED's
# I learnt some physics behind how thermistors and capacitors work
# Then created a thermometer using this knowledge
# Added a graphical user interface
# Added warning lights which are displayed at various temperatures that are too hot/cold
# The user can start a timer for 1/2/5/10 minutes
# The temperature is logged every 10 seconds and the results are plotted on a graph
# Using MatPlotLib
# This code is based off / built upon Monk Makes project 4: Thermometer Electronic Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi
